🚨 SilentGuardian AI – Multimodal Women Safety System

🛡️ An AI-powered real-time safety system that detects threats using audio intelligence, NLP, and contextual signals, and triggers emergency alerts when danger is detected.

🌟 Overview

SilentGuardian AI is a cyber-grade multimodal threat analysis system designed to enhance women's safety.

It continuously analyzes:

🎤 Audio input (speech/emotion)
🧠 Natural language understanding
📍 Contextual signals (route deviation, motion struggle)
⚠️ Risk scoring engine

👉 Based on these inputs, the system determines whether to:

✅ Continue monitoring
🚨 Trigger SOS alerts

🧠 Key Features
🎤 Speech-to-Text (Multilingual) using Whisper
🤖 NLP-based Threat Detection (emotion + intent analysis)
⚠️ Dynamic Risk Scoring Engine (0–100 scale)
🚨 Automatic SOS Trigger System
🗺️ Safe Walk Mode (Route Monitoring Simulation)
📊 Sensor Fusion (motion + deviation + distress triggers)
🧾 Incident Logging & Evidence Storage
🎨 Interactive UI Dashboard (Streamlit)

📸 Demo Results

🟢 Low Risk Scenario
Input: “Help me please”
Risk Score: 23.1
Output: ✅ No SOS Triggered

🔴 High Risk Scenario
Input: “I am in danger”
Risk Score: 75.5
Output: 🚨 SOS Triggered


🧪 How It Works
1. 🎤 Audio Processing
User uploads audio input
Converted to text using Whisper
2. 🤖 NLP Analysis
Detects:
Emotion (calm / panic)
Threat intent
Abusive language
3. ⚠️ Risk Engine

Risk is calculated using:

Risk Score =
  (Threat Level)
+ (Emotion Intensity)
+ (Route Deviation)
+ (Motion Struggle)
+ (Silent Trigger)
  
4. 🚨 Decision Logic
IF Risk Score > Threshold:
    Trigger SOS
ELSE:
    Continue Monitoring
   
🗺️ Safe Walk Mode (Simulation)
User sets:
Start location
Destination
System tracks:
Route deviation
Movement irregularities
Adds contextual risk signals
